# Polymorphic AES-MITM-Defense
This repository presents OPSPâˆ’AES, a multi-layered security model proposed in a published study to defend online payment systems against Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. It integrates Polymorphic AES with SSL protocols to secure sensitive data. Penetration testing confirms its resilience, scalability, and adaptive encryption behavior.
